# Using GANs for Artistic Style Transfer
Final project for the Machine Learning course at Tsinghua University, Fall 2020

# Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to generate Claude Monet style images from real
photos using Generative Adversarial Networks, following the Kaggle Competition
"I’m Something of a Painter Myself". We explored various GAN architectures
applied to the style transfer problem, and select CycleGAN, MUNIT and UGATIT
due to their impressive performance for similar applications. Also, we study the
effect of data augmentation and compare the architecture’s benefits and negatives.
